# ProxyChecker

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

`ProxyChecker` is a PHP class designed to validate and verify the status of proxies. It supports both **authenticated** and **non-authenticated proxies** and logs any errors encountered during the validation process. The class utilizes cURL to check proxy connections against specific URLs and provides helpful outputs such as **obfuscated IPs** for privacy purposes.
